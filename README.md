Project 4

Start with the mushroom data in the pandas DataFrame that you constructed in your “Assignment 13 –
Preprocessing Data with sci-kit learn.”
• Use scikit-learn to determine which of the two predictor columns that you selected (odor and one
other column of your choice) most accurately predicts whether or not a mushroom is poisonous. There is
an additional challenge here—to use scikit-learn’s predictive classifiers, you’ll want to convert each of
your two (numeric categorical) predictor columns into a set of columns.
• Clearly state your conclusions along with any recommendations for further analysis.
